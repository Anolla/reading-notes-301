# Creating a server using node.js and Heruko setup

1- Now, to be sure it's a web server and not just a piece of code that returns a single line of text, we'll use it as a server! You can check it with your smartphone. Let's suppose, your laptop's IP address within your local network is 192.168.1.101. You can connect to your server through the 3000th port (for this particular example) by typing http://192.168.1.101:3000/ in your browser

2- it works locally. WWW is for "World Wide Web" and we will turn your local server into a world wide server. We'll use Heroku cloud application platform for this. Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (cool long-bearded programmer guys call such type of things "PaaS"). It allows you to deploy your web server, so everyone could see how awesome you are as a web developer. First of all, you need to create an account on developer's site and install Heroku. This is not so hard. Just follow the instructions. There is also instruction on Heroku's site that can explain you how to run your first simple web server, which returns you the "Hello, World!" string. You can try it, but I think that it will be more interesting if we build our own web server from scratch

3- You are free to create your own CSS file if you don't like our design.
What we are interested in for now is how our server handles the 404 error. That's why we created two "Read more" links. The first one is connected with the actual HTML file within the public folder. The second one is broken. Let's test how it works.
