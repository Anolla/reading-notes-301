# What makes  a good team is :

1-equality, where everyone got a chance to speak roughly the same amount of time, not only one teammate speaking all the time.

2-psychologically safe environments, as good teams were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.
